          For 15 years or so (read the glorious era of my 20s where my knees didnâ€™t complain)
          I was teaching Physics to 11-18 year olds. I am now a full stack developer with
          experience in a range of technologies who enjoys making beautifully crafted, user-friendly software.

          I am originally from Glasgow, Scotland but have lived and worked in Spain, Luxembourg and London,
          leading teams in ever location! I believe that this is testament to the fact that I have the 
          guts to make bold decisions and the grit to see them through, no matter what culture I am immersed
          in or the language spoken!
