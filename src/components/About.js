        For the 15 years or so (read the glorious era of my 20s where my knees didnâ€™t complain)
      I was teaching Physics to 11-18 year olds.Now I am a full stack developer with 
      experience in a range of technologies who
      enjoys making beautifully crafted, user-friendly software.<br></br><br></br>
      I believe that meaningful software development has the power to change lives and
      uplift communities and I am excited to be able to contribute my skills and point 
      of view to the development community and those it serves.
